How does this item fit in th story is that it is the main item of the story and unlocks the truth about the Kingdom of Utopia. The person who bears this crown is the main protagonist Lily, so when she wears this crown, she will unlock the power of this crown.</p>

  <h4>Plot</h4>
<p>In the kingdom of Utopia lived a king and Queen, Ares and Hera, who gave birth to two strong children, 
  Apollo and Lily. One dreadful night, the castle was ransacked by an unknown mysterious group lead by a malicious sorcerer 
  named Demeter. The castle and city of Utopia were surrounded and the king and Quee were forced to split up, 
  Ares having Apollo in his arms and Hera having Lily in hers. Luckily for Hera and her daughter, 
  they escaped through a secret passageway in the castle, unlike her husband and her son, they were caught. 
  Hera was all by herself with her daughter in the forest running constantly for her life till she reached a small village to hide 
  in. Meanwhile, in Utopia, Demeter used her mind-controlling dark powers on the king and brainwashed him, 
  she didn't bother with Apollo since he was only a few days old. The next few days, the brainwashed Ares engaged to Demeter.
  Demeter's cruel lies about how Hera spread quickly, saying she was the one who sent the band of bandits to murder her husband to
  have the power of the throne. The people of Utopia believed in Demeter and dubbed her as their new queen of Utopia. 
  Hera soon got the news and she knew she couldn't go back to Utopia so she left Lily at the village and told the villagers 
  at the village that she was at that she'll search for him strongest warriors to take back her beloved kingdom. 
  It became the last time anyone saw Queen Hera for now. Many years passed on and little Lily is now sixteen years old, 
  living life as a pegasus village girl.
